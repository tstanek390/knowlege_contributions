## Abstract

All colon cancer patients with lymph node (LN) positive disease are treated with chemotherapy. Patients with node negative disease are usually cured by surgery alone. Yet about 20% of patients develop recurrence within 5/uni00A0years despite node negative status. This may often be the result of missed micrometastases by conventional examination. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping was developed to find those nodes detected by blue dye which was ultrastaged to detect micrometastases. Consecutive patients, underwent SLN mapping with the blue dye with success rate of 99.2%. Average number of LN was 18.3, average number of SLN was 3/patient and overall nodal positivity was 45%. Ten patients had skip metastases. Overall survival of 235 patients was 84/uni00A0months with survival of node negative patients 97/uni00A0months versus 68/uni00A0months for node positive patients. For stage I-IV patients, overall survival was as follows: stage I-115 months, stage II-90 months, stage III-84/uni00A0months and stage IV-24/uni00A0months respectively. Patients with micrometastases after chemotherapy had average survival of 108/uni00A0months versus those without chemotherapy was 50/uni00A0months. Thus, SLN mapping techniques is highly successful, easily reproducible and finds micrmoetastases in over 15% of patients which could have been missed by conventional pathological examination. These patients when treated with adjuvant chemotherapy have similar survival as those of node negative disease. Similarly, patients without any nodal metastases after SLN mapping and ultrastaging, may be considered as true node negative disease and may avoid further adjuvant chemotherapy.

cancer primarily depends on the presence of distant and nodal metastases. In the absence of distant metastases, lymph node involvement remains critical for prognosis as well as treatment plan. Patients with metastases found within any lymph node are designated as stage III and routinely treated with systemic chemotherapy. Meanwhile, patients with no evidence of nodal or distant disease may be cured by resection of the affected colon segment along with regional lymphadenectomy. Patients without any metastases (stage I, II) are not routinely treated with systemic chemotherapy. The presence of high risk factors such as T4 disease, poorly differentiated tumor, lymphovascular invasion, localized perforation, bowel obstruction, limited number of analyzed or removed lymph nodes, may allow the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in those patients [2-4]. Despite negative lymph node status in stages I and II, the recurrence rate in this group has been reported to be about

20% [2, 3]. This may be explained by: (a) biological nature of the tumor, (b) extra nodal spread, (c) insufficient surgical resection and (d) occult nodal metastases [3]. Since the early 2000's, the standard of care for accurate staging in colon cancer requires identification of at least 12 lymph nodes [5]. However, in > 50% of the surgeries, the number of the removed lymph nodes is < 12. This leads to understaging and increases the recurrence in conventional node negative disease [6]. The College of American Pathologists recommends evaluation of 12-15 nodes to confirm node negative disease. However, a meta-analysis of more than 116,000 patients, concluded that most of the cases did not have adequate lymph node evaluation [7]. Multiple publications of colon cancer resection from international centers around the globe from 1999 to 2016, of more than 400,000 patients showed that the average number of harvested LN was </uni00A012 (Table/uni00A01). Lymph node assessment and recovery can be influenced by many factors, including: (a) patient factors such as: age, gender, body habitus, immune response, (b) tumor factors such as: site, size, length of resected colon and (c) human factors: including surgeon and pathologist experience [8].

Sentinel lymph node mapping in solid tumors usually allows identification of the first 1-3 lymph nodes in the lymphatic pathway to identify those nodes at highest risk of harboring micrometastases. These few nodes then can be subjected to ultrastaging by multilevel sectioning and immunohistochemistry with cytokeratin and/or RT-PCR techniques. Such techniques may lead to identification of micrometastasis in the lymph nodes which could have been

The standard lymph node evaluation requires H&E staining of one or two sections of the LN. This technique is not suitable to detect occult nodal disease, which is a potential cause for recurrence [3]. According to TNM staging, occult nodal metastases include: Isolated tumor cells (ITC) and micrometastases (MM). ITC are defined as a group of contiguous tumor cells measuring < 0.2/uni00A0mm in greatest dimension, labeled as pN0(i+), while MM are defined as clusters of tumor cells measuring between 0.2 and 2/uni00A0mm in greatest dimension, labeled as pN1(mi) [9]. To increase the yield of lymph nodes, multiple methods have been advised i.e.; stretching and pinning of the mesentery for fixation, or use of fat clearing agents i,e Carnoys fluid ,to make the nodes visible with naked eye within the mesentery. To identify small volume disease within a lymph node, ultrastaging can be achieved by multilevel sectioning and immunohistochemistry using cytokeratin and more recently reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [10-12]. Yet, such exhaustive ultrastaging with multilevel sectioning, immunohistochemistry and/or RT-PCR on 12 or more nodes remains extremely labor-intensive and cost prohibitive. This was part of the basis of evolution of sentinel lymph node mapping in melanoma and breast cancer in early 1990s.

missed by conventional method of examination of the lymph nodes.

Sentinel lymph node mapping in colon cancer is performed together with regional lymphadenectomy unlike the more restrictive lymphadenectomies performed in melanoma and breast cancers. The method essentially helps the pathologist to better stage the patients by identifying the presence or absence of micrometastases [6]. Since multiple meta-analysis papers have shown an increase in recurrence and worse survival in patients with micrometastases when untreated [13] (Table/uni00A02), we hypothesize that sentinel lymph node mapping in colon cancer may allow a better staging technique for proper selection of adjuvant treatment.

## Methods

A prospective trial was undertaken in USA with colonoscopically proven colon cancer patients. The tumor location in each case was either documented or tattooed in case of polypectomy. At the time of the operation, sentinel lymph node mapping was done by injecting a blue dye (either 1% lymphazurin or 10% methylene blue) by a tuberculin syringe and 30 gauge needle. The dye was injected circumferentially without injecting in the lumen. Usually within 3-10/uni00A0min of injection, 1-4 blue sentinel lymph node are usually seen along the pathway of the draining vessels. The blue nodes are marked with sutures for future identification by the pathologist, as many times the sentinel lymph nodes may not be blue anymore next day in the formalin fixed specimens. The resection of the segment of colon along with regional lymphadenectomy is done as per the standard of oncological resection.

We also offered systemic chemotherapy for patients with micrometastases. All patients were followed for a minimum of 60 months or more when applicable.

In this study, all patients with nodal metastases were offered systemic chemotherapy using 5FU/leucovorin with or without oxaliplatin or Irinotecan.

## Pathological examination of/uni00A0sentinel lymph nodes

In colorectal tumors, sentinel node mapping can assist in the accurate staging [14]. Identification of sentinel nodes may further guide oncologic resection to assure that proper lymph node beds are removed and examined.

Pathologists then dissect the locoregional lymph nodes from the specimen. Standard pathologic methods include evaluation of a single hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained section of each recovered node. However, despite these standard methods, it is well-known that some node negative patients develop subsequent recurrent or metastatic tumor likely due to initial understaging by missing the

micrometastases within a small sentinel lymph node. Such failures may be due to insufficient numbers of lymph nodes being recovered and evaluated. In order to mitigate understaging due to low lymph node counts, standards from the

American College of Pathologists recommend evaluation of a minimum of 12 lymph nodes for cases of colorectal cancer [15]. It must be recognized that such a recommendation represents a minimum standard, since identification of

Sentinel lymph node mapping in colorectal cancers has the potential to point to the nodes that are most likely to harbor metastatic tumor. Evaluation of these nodes by extended pathologic evaluation would then have the potential to improve staging accuracy. Unlike cases of breast and melanoma, where sentinel node mapping is used to restrict lymphadenectomy in node negative patients, the process is different for colorectal cancers, as all regional nodes in a given basin are removed as part of the surgical procedure during colectomy. Sentinel node mapping in colorectal cancer can only improve the accuracy of staging, but will not contribute to understaging, since all nodes are still removed and evaluated at the initial operation.

greater numbers of nodes continues to be associated with higher levels of metastatic tumor, with no clear statistical breakpoint in T3 tumors even to a level of 20-22 recovered nodes [16].

During an initial study of the method, the identified sentinel lymph nodes were examined pathologically with 10 level sections through the tissue block at 40/uni00A0/uni03BC intervals by H&E stain, with a final cytokeratin (AE-1) immunostain; it was noted that all positive sentinel nodes were correctly assigned by four H&E levels with a final cytokeratin stain [17]. Protocols for the pathologic evaluation of sentinel nodes have continued to vary through the literature for multiple organ sites, and likely play some role in the determination of lymph node status. Occasional cases of low-volume nodal disease such as micrometastasis or isolated tumor cells require establishment of criteria for acceptance of such cases. In initial studies, low-volume disease therefore was required to have identifiable morphology, and to be present within the plane of the section in a subcapsular or parenchymal location [17]. These requirements ensured that the occasional small fragments of tumor that may rarely be carried over to the surfaces of lymph nodes obtained during dissection of a friable tumor would not be inappropriately evaluated as metastatic tumor. Without evaluation of morphology, such carryover events may confound some molecular analyses, particularly if morphologic correlation is not performed [18]. An additional benefit of lymph node mapping in colorectal cancer is the potential identification of nodes outside the usual drainage pattern, recognition of which may lead to

extended dissection to assure proper harvesting of relevant nodes [19].

An additional study investigated whether the sentinel node mapping procedure alone could dislodge epithelial cells to regional nodes. In 90 patient undergoing oncologic resection, injection of tracer well away from primary tumor was performed to identify non-sentinel nodes. In 70 of the 90 patients, non-sentinel node mapping was successful, yielding 102 nodes that were all negative for epithelial cells by extended evaluation. In addition, 30 patients undergoing resection with T0/Tis disease had 86 lymph nodes negative for epithelial cells by extended evaluation. These studies suggest that the mapping procedure alone does not dislodge epithelial cells to regional lymph nodes to cause false positive designation [21].

When sentinel lymph node technique was applied to a series of patients (n = 413) versus patients who underwent conventional surgery (n = 372), there was upstaging at every T stage, with an overall upstaging of about 14%. In a cohort of 200 patients at our facility we noted a 21% positive rate for the sentinel lymph nodes examined by our protocol of four level H&E sections with one cytokeratin section, and noted a 9% positive rate in the non-sentinel lymph nodes examined by a single H&E section [20]. In order to evaluate whether more focused examination alone was responsible for the upstaging of the sentinel nodes, we applied the same sentinel node protocol to 2065 initially negative non-sentinel nodes in this group of 200 patients. Of these, 12 additional positive nodes were identified (0.6%), in 12 of the 200 patients. Of these 12 patients, sentinel lymph nodes were already positive in ten patients. Hence, addition of these extra section to all of the initially negative non sentinel lymph nodes resulted in upstaging in only 2 (1%) of the 200 patients [20]. These findings suggest that intensive study of non-sentinel nodes does not significantly increase additional disease detection.

It is known that most positive lymph nodes are small, typically less than 5/uni00A0mm, and that up to 75% of positive lymph nodes may in fact be </uni00A02/uni00A0mm in size [22, 23]. To evaluate whether sentinel lymph node mapping identified such small nodes, we measured node sizes for 3519 lymph nodes from 252 patients. We found that the mean size of sentinel nodes

was 5.5/uni00A0mm and of non-sentinel nodes was 3.7/uni00A0mm. Positive sentinel nodes had a mean size of 8.7/uni00A0mm compared to a mean size of 3.5/uni00A0mm for positive non-sentinel nodes. These findings suggest that sentinel nodes, whether positive or negative, are larger than non-sentinel nodes, possibly as a hyperplastic/immunogenic response to tumor (unpublished).

Although sentinel lymph node mapping in colorectal cancer allows for more accurate staging of tumor, the effect on prognosis has remained somewhat controversial, particularly since much of the upstaging involves low-volume disease. Nevertheless, as a number of studies have matured, there does appear to be a potentially significant prognostic effect provided by the upstaging that sentinel lymph node mapping affords. Furthermore, patients who are assigned to a lymph node negative category based on sentinel node mapping, are more likely to represent truly node negative patients who may then forgo adjuvant therapy.

## Results

The SLN mapping was done in > 300 consecutive patients. Of these, patients who died from other causes unrelated to colon cancer were excluded from this analysis. The remaining 235 consecutive patients underwent in/uni00A0vivo SLN mapping at the time of surgery. There were 119 females and 116 males with a mean age of 66/uni00A0years.

Of the 235 patients, SLN mapping was successful in 99.2% of the patients. Skip metastases was found in ten of the patients where the blue sentinel lymph node was negative but other non sentinel nodes were positive for metastases.

The average tumor size was 4.23/uni00A0cm with average number of harvested LN 18.33 and average number of sentinel lymph nodes of 3. (Table/uni00A03).

Table/uni00A04 showed the average survival of 235 patients in months. Average survival for node negative patients was 97.4 months versus 67.8 months for node positive patients (p < 0.001). Average survival by TNM staging were as follows: stage I-115 months, stage II-89.7 months, stage III-84 months and stage IV-24.25 months respectively. (Table/uni00A04).

Thirty patients with only one positive lymph node and micrometastases, were treated with chemotherapy with average survival of 108 months. Six patients with only one positive lymph node and micrometastases had refused chemotherapy. The average survival of these six patients was 50 months. Overall, the average survival of these 235 patients was 84.2 months.

## Discussion

Colon cancer patients without distant and nodal metastases (stage I/II) can be cured by surgery alone in most cases without any systemic therapy. Systemic therapy however is the standard of care for patients with nodal metastases (stage III). As the cure rates of stage I/II patients are usually 80-90%, medical oncologists have identified various tumor related factors for the indications of systemic therapy in node negative patients. Hence, routine use of systemic therapy is clearly indicated in any patient with node positive disease and some specific patients with node negative disease with high risk features.

Sentinel lymph node mapping in colon cancer has primarily been used in colon cancer patients to aid the pathologists in identifying nodal disease, either micro or macrometastases. The ultrastaging of the few sentinel lymph nodes have been shown to identify at least 15% of N0 patients with micrometastases [6]. Even though in early 2000s, the reports of prognostic effect of micrometastases was somewhat controversial, by mid 2005-2015, there are multiple authors

who have established the prognostic significance of missed micrometastases in colon cancer, resulting in increased recurrence and decreased survival [13]. Sentinel lymph node mapping essentially have identified these patients with micrometastases which could have been missed by conventional pathological examination. As undiagnosed and untreated patients with micrometastases results in decreased survival, treating these patients with systemic chemotherapy is thought to be logical. The preference of using systemic chemotherapy in patients with nodal micrometastasis varies between surgical oncologists and medical oncologists. A national survey of society of surgical oncology (SSO) and American society of medical oncology (ASCO) members in 2012, showed 68% of medical oncologists and 51% of surgical oncologists would treat patients with micrometastases by systemic chemotherapy [24].

Even if the reported skip metastases in multiple series varied from 5 to 25% and are much higher than that found in breast and melanoma, there is a fundamental difference between the two. In breast and melanoma, the primary purpose of lymph node mapping is to avoid unnecessary complete nodal resection in more than 75% of patients whose sentinel lymph nodes are negative for metastases. In these diseases, only the sentinel lymph nodes are resected and skip metastases if present were not diagnosed at the time of initial operation, but appears later in the follow up period usually within 2/uni00A0years. This may have serious negative impact on the prognosis of patients with breast cancer and melanoma.

In our patients who have only one node positive lymph node with micrometastases, and were treated with systemic therapy, the average survival was 108 months versus 50 months for patients with no therapy. In fact, average survival of micrometastases positive patients in this series is even slightly higher than patients with stage I/II disease who were not treated with systemic therapy (108 vs. 97.4 months).

In colon cancer, patients undergoing lymphatic mapping, all the draining regional lymph nodes including sentinel lymph nodes are resected at the time of the initial operation. Pathologically, both the sentinel lymph nodes and non sentinel lymph nodes are examined. Any positive lymph nodes whether true positive (+ve SLN) or false negative (skip mets in non SLN), are designated as stage III disease. All these patients are candidates for systemic therapy. Hence, unlike in breast and melanoma, sentinel lymph node mapping in colon cancer doesn't underdiagnose or undertreat any patients in spite of of having skip metastases. Hence, skip metastasis in colon cancer has no clinical significance.

Other than the negative prognostic effect of presence of micrometastases in the lymph nodes, micrometastases in the bone marrow (BM) (disseminated tumor cells; DTCs) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in blood have also been evaluated by many authors. Presence of BM micrometastases in 144 stage I-III colon cancer patients had worse

outcome compared to BM negative patients with a hazard ratio of 1.33 (95% CI) for disease specific survival and hazard ratio of 1.30 for overall survival [25]. A meta-analysis of cancer cell in lymph nodes, BM and peripheral blood and its clinical significance by Leong et/uni00A0al. showed that both micrometastatic cells LN and peripheral blood as well as BM have deleterious effects on recurrence and survival in colon cancer patients [26]. Similar meta-analysis of DTC and CTC in colorectal cancer patients by Rahbari et/uni00A0al. further confirmed that hazard ratio of 3.24 (95% CI) for recurrence free survival and 2.28 for overall survival in colorectal cancer patients with positive DTCs and CTCs [27]. Thus, micrometastases in LN is in the pathway of evolution of further systemic micrometastases. All of this have negative impact on recurrence and survival unless treated with systemic therapy.

In lieu of such expensive genetic and molecular studies of the primary tumor, sentinel lymph node mapping in colon cancer provides a relatively easy, easily reproducible and inexpensive way to perform oncologic resection with high probability of finding those patients with nodal micrometastases which could have been missed by conventional methods.

In the future, more genetic and molecular markers of the primary tumors may give insights into the potential metastatic spread of the tumor in a particular patient and may guide appropriate therapy. This however is not the standard of care today.

This relatively easily adaptable technique has potential to find those patients who really can benefit from systemic chemotherapy vs avoiding expensive toxic therapy for those patients who have truly node negative status as determined by lymphatic mapping.
